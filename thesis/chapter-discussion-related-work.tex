    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reiterate what was achieved
        \item Compare to other \acp{EDSL} for similarities and differences
            \subitem To normal functional hardware DSLs, highlight how π types help
            \subitem To DTP hardware EDSLs, focusing on differences
    \end{itemize}

    % μFP similarities
    %     Double interpretation – simulation and synthesis
    %     Single construct for introducing state – μ
    %       (reiterate shift register example and show Π-Ware code)
    % μFP differences
    %     The synthesis interpretation is not geometrical, but only produces a netlist
    %     Π-Ware is of course embedded, so hardware connection patterns are expressed
    %       by explicit operators instead of language builtins (_>>'_ instead of application)

    % Lava similarities
    %     Deep embedded
    %     Synthesis and simulation
    %     Kinda same idea of connection patterns?
    % Lava differences
    %     No model checking output – no need as there's native proving using Agda
    %     Proofs can be written for statements regarding whole families of circuits (for all sizes, etc)
    %     High-level layer of types instead of just Bools, lists and tuples

    % ForSyDe similarities
    %     Deep embedded
    %     Uses statically-sized vectors (just an emulation of dependent types)
    %     Simulation and synthesis (synthesis to hierarchical VHDL)
    % ForSyDe differences
    %     No facilities to reason about and prove circuit properties
    %     Π-Ware only deals with the synchronous model of computation
