{\centering \textbf{Acknowledgments}\\[5mm]}

I would like to sincerely thank my supervisor, Wouter Swierstra, for
the helpful insight, patience and optimism in all of those weekly meetings.
Special gratitude goes to all of my friends and colleagues who
reviewed drafts of this report: your helpful critique was precious to smoothen the "rough edges".
Of course I cannot forget to thank the Agda community, also
the developers of LaTeX, Vim, Emacs and all other tools used in the daily writing ritual.
All of my best friends, from Utrecht and from abroad, have made the
pressure of deadlines more bearable with those nights out and weekends in the city.
Most of all, I would like to thank my parents: their support was always unconditional,
and their pride was and remains a big motivation.
Thank you Mariela for all the help in the most important moments.
