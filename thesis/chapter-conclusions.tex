\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chap:conclusions}
    %% TODO: before the sections, "tie the knots" and give a general conclusion

    \section{Current limitations}
    \label{sec:current-limitations}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Synthesizable instances are not proven bijections?
            \item Big circuits consume too much time and memory to typecheck
                \subitem Who to blame?
                \subitem Instance search
                \subitem Combinational proofs
            \item Circuit interfaces are described by \emph{just a size}
                \subitem Simple, but generates ugly VHDL
                \subitem All circuits have one big vector input and one output
                \subitem Could we make the interface indices more \emph{structured}?
        \end{itemize}

    \section{Future research}
    \label{sec:future-research}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item More broadly, considering \emph{Î -Ware}, what would be the ``next steps''.
            \item Map arbitrary Agda types to words (via sum-of-products) in a GP way.
        \end{itemize}
