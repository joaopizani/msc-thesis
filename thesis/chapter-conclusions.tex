        \begin{itemize}
            \item Reiterate what was achieved
            \item Compare to other \acp{EDSL} for similarities and differences

        \subsection{Current limitations}
        \label{subsec:current-limitations}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item What problems \emph{Π-Ware} still has.
                    \subitem With suggestions for how to solve them, if possible
                \item Synthesizable instances are not proven bijections
                \item Big circuits consume too much time and memory to typecheck
                    \subitem Who to blame?
                    \subitem Instance search
                    \subitem Combinational proofs
            \end{itemize}

        \subsection{Future research}
        \label{subsec:future-research}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item More broadly, considering \emph{Π-Ware}, what would be the ``next steps''.
            \end{itemize}
